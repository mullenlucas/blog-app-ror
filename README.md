## Database ERD Diagram :memo:

![](./blog_app_erd.png)

## Built With :hammer_and_wrench:

- **Ruby** Popular programming language that‚Äôs used for lots of things, from web app development to data analysis.
- **Gitflow** Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development
- **Linter checks (rubocop)** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code
- **Rails** [v 7.0.4] - A server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License
  -- **PostgreSQL** A powerful, open source object-relational database system

## Getting started

### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mullenlucas/blog-app.ror.git
cd blog-app-ror
```

### Check your Ruby version

```shell
ruby --version && irb
```

The ouput should start with something like `ruby 3.1.2`

If not, install the right ruby version using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (it could take a while):

```shell
rbenv install 3.1.2
```

- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rails server`
- Open Browser `http://localhost:3000/`
- Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed before running the application `psql --version`
- Run `rails db:create`.
- Create a `.envs` file using the link to host postgres credentials.

### Testing

To test and utilize the code, use the terminal and run ruby by inputting `irb` in the command line, or by using an extension in Visual Studio Code like _Code runner_

The user then can modify and play with the files as needed

<!-- ### Install dependencies

Using [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler) and [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn):

```shell
bundle && yarn
``` -->
